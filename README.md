# Docker Fundamentals – Adrian Cantrill Course

This repository contains my documentation, mini projects, and hands-on work based on **Adrian Cantrill’s Docker Fundamentals training course**.

The course covers the **core concepts of Docker**, including:

- Creating and managing Docker containers from scratch  
- Deploying applications across various environments using Docker  
- Working with persistent storage for containers  
- Exploring Docker networking features  
- An introduction to orchestration concepts  

It includes both **theoretical lessons** and **practical exercises**, with demo projects that reflect real-world scenarios.  

Through this training, I developed a strong understanding of Docker's inner workings and how to apply it effectively. The included mini projects helped bridge the gap between learning and real-world usage.

After completing the course, I’m confident in my foundational Docker skills and plan to build on them by creating and showcasing **real-world, Docker-based projects** on my GitHub.
